<p>My Favourite is playing sports especially badminton . Badminton is a dynamic and exhilarating sport that combines speed, strategy, and agility. Whether played for fitness, competition, or leisure, it offers a fantastic way to stay active and focused. The joy of a well-placed smash or a perfectly executed drop shot makes badminton both challenging and rewarding.</p>
